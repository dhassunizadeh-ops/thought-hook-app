# Week 3 UX Visual — Krug × Norman × Eyal

An interactive prototype demonstrating core UX principles from Steve Krug's *Don't Make Me Think*, Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, and Nir Eyal's *Hooked*.

## What It Teaches

- **Krug (Usability)**: One obvious primary action (+ New button), clear interface hierarchy, minimal cognitive load
- **Norman (Design Principles)**: Signifiers and mapping (intuitive icons), immediate feedback (toast notifications), visible system status (streak counter)
- **Eyal (Hook Model)**: Complete engagement loop with trigger (visible streak), action (add note), variable reward (toast + streak increment), and investment (saved notes build user commitment)

## Features

- 🎯 Clean, iOS-inspired note-taking interface
- 🔥 Streak tracking for habit formation
- 🔍 Real-time search functionality
- ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts (press 'N' to add note)
- ♿ Accessible design with focus rings and ARIA labels
- 🎮 Demo controls (reset, 2-minute timer)
- ⚙️ Ethical design toggles (notification controls, time tracking)
- 📱 Educational tooltips explaining UX principles
